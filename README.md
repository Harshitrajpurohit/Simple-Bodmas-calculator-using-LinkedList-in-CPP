# Efficient BODMAS Calculator Using LinkedList in C++

This calculator program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The calculator supports multiple operations chained together and evaluates the expression when the "=" button is pressed. The entire program is implemented using Linked List in C++ for efficient handling and manipulation of the input expressions.

## **Features**
1. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Allows chaining of multiple operations.
3. Uses Linked List for efficient expression management.
4. Provides accurate results for complex expressions.
   
## **How to Use**
1. Input the arithmetic expression using the supported operators.
2. Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression.
3. The result will be displayed immediately.

## **Example Usage**
### **Input1**
20 + 30 * 40 - 10 / 5 = 
### **Output1**
1218
